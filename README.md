## Hey! 👋

My name is **Dhanwanth**, a first-year Computer Engineering student at the University at Buffalo, with a passion for building technology that's powerful and intuitive.

My journey into tech began from a curiosity about how the digital tools I used every day actually worked. This notion led me down a rabbit hole of automating parts of my life and putting websites on the web. I was hooked on the feeling of creating something functional from nothing but code, which naturally led me to pursue Computer Engineering.

Currently at UB, I'm building a strong foundation in both hardware and software. I'm always looking for opportunities to apply my skills, whether it's through a challenging academic project or my own personal ventures.

I'm particularly interested in the startup world and am excited by the prospect of building innovative projects from the ground up. I'm always open to discussing new projects and opportunities—feel free to reach out!

Thanks for visiting,
Dhanwanth Parameswar
